Description: The 'Figma' API allows for interactions and read access to 'Figma'
 files <https://www.figma.com/developers/api>. This enables you to inspect any 
 objects or layers, as well as their properties, and extract them so you may 
 render them as images outside of 'Figma'. Then you can present your designs,
 extract design data that can be used for 'Shiny' and 'Rmarkdown', integrate 
 them with other systems, or use them to realize your original ideas.
